# ML-capstone-Project
## Creating Gender Prediction model using Dental Metrics
 This Project demonstrate the implementation and comaprison of machine learning model to check best model for Gender prediction using dental matrics
 ## The models used for comparison are:
 1. Logistic Regration
 2. Decision Tree
 3. Random Forest
 4. XGBoost

### Where we got below results:
1. Logistic Regration = 0.52
2. Decision Tree = 0.86
3. Random Forest = 0.87
4. XGBoost = 0.87

## Coclusion:
**Higher AUC value** means better model
in this case **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** models are having highest AUC value

### Visualiation
The project includes ROC curve for each model for visual comparison
